# Scientific Self-Determination: Data Integration Architecture (Expanded Technical Specs)

---

## 1. Collaborative Veto Page
**Base Source** [Concurrent Majority](https://mises.org/mises-wire/calhouns-doctrine-concurrent-majority)

  * **Concepts** It was designed to prevent the "tyranny of the majority" by allowing distinct interest groups or regions to have a formal "negative" (veto) on the actions of the government to ensure broad consensus.

  * **Additional Source** [confederate constitution](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp)

**Target Interface:** ['CollaborativeVetoDeskopPage.png'](../../../docs/Founding/ScreenSequenceIMG/CollaberativeVetoDeskopPage.png) 
**Objective:** Map federal and state hierarchies to simulate a localized, cascading veto mechanism.

### Methodology & Data Depth
* **The "Universe" of Government:** By utilizing the **Census of Governments**, we don't just see "States," but a relational database of all 89,000+ General Purpose and Special Purpose governments. 
    * **Data Source:** [Census Bureau - Census of Governments](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cog.html)
* **The Veto Algorithm:** The backend implements a "bottom-up" consensus check. 
    * **Logic:** `IF (Veto_Count / Total_Municipal_Units) >= 0.33 THEN County_Veto = TRUE`.
* **Legal Preemption Mapping:** We use the **Congressional Research Service (CRS)** reports to categorize laws by "Preemption Level." 
    * **Data Source:** [CRS Report - Federalism & State Sovereignty](https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs5387/)
    * **Application:** This allows the UI to highlight "Soft Targets", areas like local zoning or education where state/local autonomy is legally robust, versus "Hard Targets" like National Defense.
* **Historical Logic:** We utilize **ACIR (Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations)** reports to understand the "Home Rule" status of different counties.
    * **Data Source:** [ACIR Reports Digital Archive](https://library.unt.edu/gpo/acir/index.html)
    * **Application:** This weights the "Veto" power differently depending on the state’s historical stance on local autonomy.

## 2. Multi-choice Voting Page
**Base Source** [Approval Votings](https://electionscience.org/education/approval-voting)

  * **Concepts** It seeks to solve the mathematical flaws of "Plurality Voting" (where you only pick one), allowing for a more accurate reflection of the electorate's will without the complexity of ranking candidates.

 * **Additional Source** [confederate constitution](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp)

**Target Interface:** [`MultipleChoiceVotingDesktopPage.png`](../../../docs/Founding/ScreenSequenceIMG/MultipleChoiceVotingDesktopPage.png) 
**Objective:** Provide technical legitimacy for the UI's alternative voting interfaces.

### Methodology & Data Depth
* **Security & Interoperability:** To move beyond a "web poll," the UI adheres to the **VVSG 2.0 (Voluntary Voting System Guidelines)**.
    * **Data Source:** [NIST/EAC - VVSG 2.0 Requirements](https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/voluntary-voting-system-guidelines)
    * **Application:** This ensures that the simulation uses the same "Common Data Format" (CDF) for ballots as certified election hardware.
* **Voter Behavior Simulation:** We use the **EAVS (Election Administration and Voting Survey)**.
    * **Data Source:** [EAC - EAVS Research & Data](https://www.eac.gov/research-and-data/studies-and-reports)
    * **Application:** We pull "Ballot Rejection" data to model how voters handle complex instructions, allowing the UI to offer "Error Prevention" tooltips.
* **Tabulation Templates:** We mirror the legal frameworks of **Maine and NYC**.
    * **Data Source:** [Maine RCV Rules](https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/rcv.html) & [NYC Board of Elections](https://www.vote.nyc/page/ranked-choice-voting)
    * **Application:** The backend "Tally Engine" runs the exact recursive elimination algorithm used in these jurisdictions to ensure mathematical accuracy.

## 3. Supreme Court Check Page
**Base Source** [The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798](https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/virginia-and-kentucky-resolutions-of-1798/)

  * **Concepts** Authored by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, these resolutions argued that the Constitution was a "compact" between states. They proposed that states have the right to "interpose" or nullify federal acts (including court rulings) they deem unconstitutional.

    * **Additional Source** [Virgina declaration of rights](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/virginia-declaration-of-rights)

**Target Interface:** [`SupremeCourtCheckDesktopPage.png`](../../../docs/Founding/ScreenSequenceIMG/SupremeCourtCheckDesktopPage.png)
**Objective:** Ground the 26-state override concept in established Constitutional frameworks.

### Methodology & Data Depth
* **The "Exceptions Clause":** We ground the override in **Article III, Section 2** of the Constitution via the **Constitution Annotated (CONAN)**.
    * **Data Source:** [Constitution Annotated - Article III](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-3/)
    * **Application:** It illustrates that Congress (and by extension, the States) has the power to define the "Exceptions" to the Court's appellate jurisdiction.
* **Procedural Baseline:** Using **U.S. Courts** data, we establish the current "Rule of Four."
    * **Data Source:** [U.S. Courts - Supreme Court Procedures](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/)
    * **Application:** The simulation posits a "Rule of 26" as a direct evolutionary successor to this procedural norm.
* **Structural Flexibility:** The **Federal Judicial Center (FJC)** provides historical data on the creation of "Article I" (Legislative) courts.
    * **Data Source:** [FJC - History of the Federal Judiciary](https://www.fjc.gov/history)
    * **Application:** This proves that the structure of the judiciary is a legislative construct that can be modified to include a state-override check.
* **Philosophical Weight:** We pull from **The Federalist Papers (No. 78 and No. 81)**.
    * **Data Source:** [GovInfo - The Federalist Papers](https://www.govinfo.gov/collection/federalist-papers)

## 4. Minimum Amount of Space Page
**Base Source** [Georgism](https://progressandpovertyinstitute.org/the-basic-fundamentals-of-georgism/)

  * **Concepts** George argued that while people should own the value they create, the land itself belongs to all of humanity. This concept also leans on Communitarianism and the historical "Homestead" ideals of providing a baseline of self-sufficiency through land.

   * **Additional Source** [confederate constitution](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp)

**Target Interface:** [`MinimumAmountOfSpaceDesktop.png`](../../../docs/Founding/ScreenSequenceIMG/MinimumAmountOfSpaceDesktop.png)  
**Objective:** Calculate and visualize spatial allocation using the mathematical formula.

### Methodology & Data Depth
* **The Spatial Formula:** $Sovereign\ Area = (Height \times 3)^2$
    * **Logic:** This calculates a "physiological buffer zone." For an average height of 1.75m, the formula requires a ~27.5 square meter footprint per person.
* **The Land-Subtraction Algorithm:** We start with the **BLM Public Land Statistics**.
    * **Data Source:** [BLM - Public Land Statistics 2024](https://www.blm.gov/about/data/public-land-statistics)
    * **Logic:** The total acreage (245M acres) is the "gross" value. We then use **USDA MULU** reports to subtract "non-habitable" land.
    * **Data Source:** [USDA ERS - Major Land Uses (MULU)](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/land-use-land-value-tenure/major-land-uses)
* **GIS Visualization:** The final layer uses **USGS GIS data**.
    * **Data Source:** [USGS - National Land Cover Database (NLCD)](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/national-land-cover-database) & [PAD-US (Protected Areas Database)](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/science/protected-areas-database-us-pad-us)
    * **Application:** Using D3.js, the UI renders a hexagonal grid over habitable land in Wyoming, excluding USGS-tagged "Protected Areas" (National Parks) and "Water Bodies."
