    <h1>Multi-Choice Voting</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong> Multi-choice voting permits citizens to cast votes for every candidate they support rather than being limited to a single selection. 
        This approach eliminates the "spoiler effect" and reduces the need for strategic voting by allowing a broader expression of voter preference. 
        The candidate with the highest total support wins, more accurately reflecting the collective will of the electorate.
    </p>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        In a traditional "choose-one" election, you are forced to pick a single person, even if you like several candidates or feel like you are choosing the "lesser of two evils." 
        With multi-choice voting, if five people are running, you can check the box for one, three, or even all five of them (but only once per candidate).
    </p>
    <p>
        The candidate with the most votes wins, even if they don't have a majority. 
        This means that if you like three candidates, you can vote for all three without worrying about splitting the vote and accidentally helping your least favorite candidate win.
    </p>
    <p>
        This system is designed to solve the "spoiler effect." This happens in standard elections when two similar candidates "split" the votes of their supporters, accidentally allowing a candidate that the majority of people dislike to win. 
        Because you can support multiple people under this system, you don't have to worry about "wasting" your vote on an underdog.
    </p>
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Multi-choice voting allows for a more accurate representation of voter preferences. 
        It encourages candidates to appeal to a broader base of voters, rather than just trying to be the "lesser evil." 
        This can lead to more positive campaigning and a more diverse range of candidates running for office.
    </p>
    <p>
        Encouraging participation in elections is another key benefit. 
        When voters understand they can support multiple candidates, they are more likely to vote, especially if they believe their preferred candidate has a chance to win.
    </p>
    <p>
        More accurate representation of voter preferences can lead to better policy outcomes. 
        When elected officials know they need to appeal to a broader base, they may be more likely to adopt policies that reflect the interests of a wider range of constituents.
